# PromptWiz

## Overview

PromptWiz is a robust application that enhances the user's prompts to guide ChatGPT for providing more accurate and contextually apt responses. The application is built on Vue 3, taking advantage of modern JavaScript features and design patterns.

PromptWiz's key features are built using various popular libraries such as axios, lodash, vue-router, vuex and more. It leverages Vite as the build tool, which is faster and leaner than traditional web tooling.
